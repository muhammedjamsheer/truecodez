        <p>Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).</p>
        <p>we can declare javascript variables in 3 types <b>var</b>, <b>let</b> ,<b>const</b></p>

        <div class="subheader">Var</div>
        <p>It is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in js</p>
        <p>Variables declared with var are in the function scope and can be Redeclared.</p>

        <div class="subheader">Let</div>
        <p>The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)</p>
        <p>Variables declared with let have Block Scope ie, Variables declared inside a curly brace cannot be accessed
            from outside the block.</p>
        <p>Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared and must be declared before use.</p>

        <div class="subheader">Const</div>
        <p>The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)</p>
        <p>Variables declared with const have Block Scope.</p>
        <p>JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:</p>
        <p>Variables declared with Const cannot be Redeclared and const cannot be Reassigned.</p>

        <hr>
        <div class="subheader">Cannot be Redeclared</div>
        <p>Variables defined with let and const cannot be redeclared.</p>
        <ngx-prism language="javascript">
            {{codes.let_redeclare}}
        </ngx-prism>
        <p>With var you can:</p>
        <ngx-prism language="javascript">
            {{codes.var_redeclare}}
        </ngx-prism>

        <div class="subheader">Block Scope</div>
        <p>Let and Const are block scoped</p>
        <p>Variables declared inside a curly brace cannot be accessed from outside the block:</p>
        <ngx-prism language="javascript">
            {{codes.let_blockscope}}
        </ngx-prism>
        <p>Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:</p>
        <ngx-prism language="javascript">
            {{codes.let_blockscope2}}
        </ngx-prism>

        <div class="subheader"> Cannot be Reassigned</div>
        <p>A const variable cannot be reassigned:</p>
        <ngx-prism language="javascript">
            {{codes.const_reassigned}}
        </ngx-prism>

        <p>JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:</p>
        <ngx-prism language="javascript">
            {{codes.const_assigned}}
        </ngx-prism>
