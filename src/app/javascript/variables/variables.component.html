        <h5>Reactive forms in Angular</h5>

        <p>Reactive forms are forms where we define the structure of the form in the component class. Then, we bind it
            to
            the HTML form in the template.</p>
        <P> This is different from the template-driven forms, where we define the logic and controls in the HTML
            template.
        </P>
