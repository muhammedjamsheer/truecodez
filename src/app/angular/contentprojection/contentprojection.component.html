    <h5>Content Projection</h5>
    <p> We know how to use @Input decorator to pass data from the parent component to the child component.
        But it is only limited to data. We cannot use that technique to pass the content which includes the HTML
        elements, CSS, etc to the child component. To do that we have to make use of content projection.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Content projection is a way to pass the HTML content from the parent component to the child component. The child
        component will display the template in a designated spot. We use the ng-content element to designate a spot in
        the template of the child component. The ng-content also allows us to create multiple slots using the selector
        attribute. The parent can send different content to each slot.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheader"> ng-content </p>
    <p>The ng-content tag acts as a placeholder for inserting external or dynamic content. The Parent component passes
        the external content to the child component. When Angular parses the template, it inserts the external content
        where ng-content appears in the child componentâ€™s template</p>
    <br>

    <p> We can use content projection to create a reusable component. The components that have similar logic & layout
        and can be used in many places in the application.</p>

    <p class="subheader">ng-content Example </p>


    <p><b>ParentComponent.html</b></p>
    <ngx-prism language="html">
        {{parentcomponent_html}}
    </ngx-prism>

    <p>The content between app-child is passed to our parent content. The component displays it in place of ng-content.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="subheader">Events</p>
    <p>The events like click, input, etc bubble up. Hence can be captured in the parent as shown below</p>

    <ngx-prism language="html">
        {{events}}
    </ngx-prism>

    <br>
    <p class="subheader"> Multiple Projections using ng-content</p>
    <ngx-prism language="html">
        {{Multiple_Projections}}
    </ngx-prism>
    <p>Similarly, you can use the various CSS Selectors as shown below</p>
    <ngx-prism language="html">
        {{various_selectors}}
    </ngx-prism>
